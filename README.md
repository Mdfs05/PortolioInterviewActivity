# Portolio Interview Activity by Marlon Schellhorn
My (Marlon Schellhorn's) portfolio containing a collection of 10 modules I have worked on throughout the semester. This contains modules from Khan Academy, Code Academy and Projects/Assignments we have worked on. The portfolio is active on GitHub pages to view.

**Note that if you hear music in the portfolio, it is coming from the Hackathon website embedded into the portfolio and you can mute the website.**
